    <h2>Benefits of a Wedding Guest Book</h2>
    <div class="post_content">

        <p1>A wedding guestbook is sometimes viewed as an old wedding tradition that does not seem necessary. However, long gone are the days of guests simply writing their names in a book you’ll never look at again. Here are the benefits of the modern wedding guest book:</p1>

        <p><b>A keepsake</b>: It can be difficult to save items from your wedding day. Flowers unfortunately do not last, cake will be eaten, and that centrepiece may take up too much space, but a guestbook (in addition to your wedding photos of course) is a great long term keepsake to remember your special day.</p>
        
        <p><b>A memory from your guests</b>: Wedding cards are great to read in the moment, but chances are you do not want to keep piles of cards in a box long-term. A guest book allows memories from your guests to be in one single spot and takes up limited space on a shelf.</p>
        
        <p><b>Personalized look</b>: You can personalize guest books to include photos of you and your partner (and even customize the colours to match your wedding décor! Keep reading and we’ll tell you how).</p>
        
        <p><b>Customize messages</b>: A guest book does not have to be simply having guests write their names or simple messages. Have some fun and ask guests to share date ideas or marriage advice! Fill up the pages by asking guests to answer questions like “What do you do when your partner is upset?” or “What is the key to a successful marriage?”</p>
        
        <p>So, where can you get a customized modern wedding guest book and other stationery? We recommend Basic Invite! Basic Inviteoffers personalized wedding guest books (in addition to wedding invitation sets, menu cards, programs, and all of your wedding stationery needs!). What makes Basic Invite different than other stationery companies?</p>
        
        <p><b>Sophisticated Guestbook</b>: Basic Invite guest books have a ring hidden inside which allows them to lay perfectly flat for a classy and convenient look.</p>
        
        <p><b>Custom colours:</b> Basic Invite is one of the few websites that allows customers almost unlimited color options with instant previews online.</p>
        
        <p><b>Custom samples:</b> Basic Invite is one of the few websites that allows customers the ability to order a sample wedding invitation prior to finalizing their order.</p>
