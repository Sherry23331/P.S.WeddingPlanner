            <p class="review-text">
                “An Indian wedding can be extremely difficult and stressful to plan and coordinate, and having a wedding planner who is experienced, professional and quick to handle requests is priceless! We hired Poonam and her team for day of coordination for all our wedding events. All of our wedding events were exactly like how we have envisioned and it wouldn’t have been the same without the exceptional organizational skills and commitment Poonam offered our families and us. Over the course of planning for our wedding, Poonam always made sure that she was available to us. She replied to all of our messages with a high level of detail, and in a very timely manner. We always felt supported through the planning process and we are so appreciative of all the knowledge and suggestions she shared with us. On the day of our wedding, every detail we had discussed was flawlessly executed. We had the privilege of enjoying every moment of our wedding, as Poonam took care of everything. Our families were so thankful for all of the hard work that Poonam did as it truly allowed them to enjoy our special day, stress free. Poonam is passionate, knowledgeable and incredibly capable. We would highly recommended Poonam and her team to anyone that is looking for a wedding planner. ”
